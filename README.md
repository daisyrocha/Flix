### Notes
For some reason I kept getting UI errors that I could not get help on. I had to restart the entire project beginning from Unit 1. Once getting to a certain point in Unit 2, I kept having the same issue, even after carefully following the video. I had to comment out the code, then uncomment it and it worked after that.
